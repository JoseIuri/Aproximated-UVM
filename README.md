# Aproximated UVM

This repository contains a proposal UVM testbench for aproximated circuits.

This repository uses DUTs found at EvoApprox8b - Approximate Adders and Multipliers Library (https://ehw.fit.vutbr.cz/evoapproxlib/)

V. Mrazek, R. Hrbacek, Z. Vasicek and L. Sekanina, EvoApprox8b: Library of approximate adders and multipliers for circuit design and benchmarking of approximation methods. Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2017, Lausanne, 2017, pp. 258-261.

## Getting Started

This Testbench architecture can track the error metrics defined for correct functionality of the circuit. At the end of simulation the result is shown.

### Prerequisites

```
UVM 1.2

Cadence xrun(64): 18.09-s011

or

Synopsys vcs version : O-2018.09
```

## Running the tests

To run the simulation just do the make command.

```
make
```

If you want to change the simulaltor just modify the symbolic link:

```
ln -s Makefile.spns Makefile
```
